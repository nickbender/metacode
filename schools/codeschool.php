          <p>Most people donâ€™t learn to program and design for the web by reading a book. Real learning takes place when you start experimenting with code in the browser and using design concepts in a website.</p>
          <p>In our opinion, the best way to learn is by doing. Code School opens the door to a new way of learning by combining video, coding in the browser, and gamification to make learning a new technology fun!</p>
          <p>Code School is an online learning platform that teaches a variety of programming and web design skills. Courses range from beginner to advanced levels and you get to earn rewards and badges as you learn.</p>
          <p>Our courses use screencasts and interactive exercises to guide you to better code. Each course has at least five levels. Each level begins with a 10-15 minute screencast, followed by a series of code challenges you must solve to make it to the next level.</p>
