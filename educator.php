    				(Filler text lovingly provided by <a href="http://niccageipsum.com">Nic Cage Ipsum</a>)Why didn't you just tell them were the microfilm was and create a solution? Well I'm one of those fortunate people who like my job sir. Got my first chemistry set when I was seven blew my eyebrows off we never saw the cat again been into it ever since. Honey? Uh... You wanna know who really killed JFK? Define combat sir. We're stuck on an island with a bunch of violence-for-pleasure-seeking psychopathic marines SHAME-ON-THEM! You know I like history too and maybe when this is all over you and I can stop by the souvenir shop together but right now I just... I just wanna find some rockets! Sorry boss but there's only two men I trust. One of them's me. The other's not you. Put... the bunny... back... in the box. They somehow managed to get every creep and freak in the universe onto this one plane. And then somehow managed to let them take it over. And then somehow managed to stick us right smack in the middle.

    				<p> What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna save the fudgein' day! Hey! My mama lives in a trailer! You fire that weapon twenty pissed-off prisoners are gonna hear it. Comprende Ese? That techno-rock you guys listen to is gutless. Well fudge you for sure like totally! Oh well Peter Piper picked a pepper I guess I did! This is pistachio paste isn't it? No but your face is. No one is gonna tell me who I can score with! Now I want this chick she wants me so fudge it we're goin' back. All right but when they attack the car save the radio. You just put it in the right file according to alphabetical order! Y'know A B C D E F G! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire! I'm a vampire!

    				I never misfiled anything! Not once. Not one time! That's right Alva. It's a horrible horrible job; sifting through old contract after old contract. I couldn't think of a more horrible job if I wanted to. And you have to do it! You have to or I'll fire you. Well the fact is I did murder someone last night. I turned into a vampire. It's a long story. I'm a vampire. Kill me!. Sorry boss but there's only two men I trust. One of them's me. The other's not you. Put... the bunny... back... in the box. They somehow managed to get every creep and freak in the universe onto this one plane. And then somehow managed to let them take it over. And then somehow managed to stick us right smack in the middle. What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna save the fudgein' day! Hey! My mama lives in a trailer!
